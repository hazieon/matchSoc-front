It's a match! 
A one week, full-stack group project to build an application for matching professional mentors from the tech field to code-learning School of Code bootcampers. 
We built this on week 8 of the School of Code bootcamp. For technologies, We used JavaScript, React.js, Node.js.
We did daily standups and retrospectives each day and ended the week by presenting our application to a live panel of guest judges.
